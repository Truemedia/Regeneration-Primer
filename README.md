## Regeneration Primer ##
A moddable frontend boilerplate for client and/or server based HTML5 applications

### Installation ###
Whether you are creating a SPA or a full stack website, this repo should serve as your public folder. If you already have a public folder, delete it and run the following command

	git clone https://github.com/Truemedia/Regeneration-Primer.git public

Install JavaScript libraries inside public folder with

	jspm install

### Packages ###
The main advantage of this frontend is that all code is encouraged to be done in packages. This allows authors to not only develop packages to their own standards, but have code which can be agnostic of a site platform (such as a contact package that can be used on both a blogging platform and an ecommerce platform).

Feel free to use any from the following list, or create and add your own:

- [anysite/contact](https://github.com/Truemedia/anysite-contact) - Contact package


### Development tools
I use my own tool chest (literally) to accompany my coding, see my [Treasure Chest](https://github.com/Truemedia/Treasure-Chest) repo for for setting up the development tools you may or may not need (already comes included in this repo). Based on [bower](http://bower.io/), [browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/), [chest](http://chestjs.com/), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/), and [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).

### Overview

This software serves as a boilerplate  for the purpose of providing a general software frontend structure that can be modified to create any web application imaginable within the scope of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript technologies.

Using the latest technologies and design patterns, this frontend repo currently incorporates this massive stack to build your application upon.
